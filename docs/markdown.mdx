# Markdown Features

___

## Table of contents

## MDX

By default **Papyrum** uses [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) which is a format that allows you to write JSX
inside our [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) documents,
you can easily import your components  inside of their files `.mdx`.

> We use MDX as the parsing engine, which can do much more than just parsing Markdown. 

Example:

Create in file `.jsx` or `.tsx`

```js
import React from 'react';

const Button = ({ children }) => <button>{children}</button>

export default Button;
```

Create in a file `.mdx`
```
import Button from './Button';

# Button
<Button>My Button!</Button>
```

## Markdown headers


They are metadata that allow papyrum to create great things, such as the sidebar,
name for menus, routes and a component that will house the list of documented components.

| Header | Description |
| - | - |
| `name` | A name that represents your document in the sidebar. |
| `menu` | When you want to add your document in a new menu. |
| `route` | You can define the name of your route, example if you want your document to be in `/my-route`, `route: my-route`. |
| `status` | You can define the status of a component, papyrum handles 3 types of status that are: development, deprecated and ready. |

In your `.mdx` file:

```
---
name: Button
menu: Components
route: my-bytton
status: development
---

# Hi!
```

Result:

<CustomBrowser route="http://localhost:3000/my-button">
  <h1 style={{color: '#5C6975'}}>Hi!</h1>
</CustomBrowser>

## Shortcodes

This feature allows you to have a component exposed for all your documents
without the need to import it, useful for components that are frequently used in your `.mdx` documents.

Papyrum has the following integrated shortcodes that will help you document:

### Playground

Playground for live editing react code.

`.mdx` file.

```
# Button
___
<Playground>
  <button>My Button!</button>
</Playground>
```

Result:

<Playground>
  <button>My Button!</button>
</Playground>

### Props

It allows us to have a table that shows us the [PropTypes](https://reactjs.org/docs/typechecking-with-proptypes.html) of our component

```
import Button from './Button';

## Props

<Props of={Button} />
```

Result:

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4754339/91013125-d80ba980-e5ac-11ea-805d-0361ece616cd.png" style={{width: '100%'}}/>

### Components

Contains the list of documented components, any document that has a header `status` will be found in this list, for example:

`Button.mdx`

```
---
status: development
---

import { Button } from './Button';

# Button

<Playground>
  <Button>My Button</Button>
</Playground>
```

Other document, `Introduction.mdx`, we import  `Components` from `@papyrum/ui-docs`.

```
### List components

<Components />
```

Result:

<img src="components-update" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4754339/91071194-83444f00-e5fd-11ea-996d-d4d4c1dc1372.png" style={{width: '100%'}}/>

### Fonts

Component that gives you a sample of the sources.

```
### Fonts

<Fonts
  fontFamily='Arial'
  fonts={['34px', '24px', '14px']}
/>
```

Result

<Fonts
  fontFamily='Arial'
  fonts={['34px', '24px', '14px']}
/>

### Palette

Component that gives you a color palette simply and quickly.

```
### Colors

<Palette colors={[
  {
    color: '#1abc9c',
    name: 'turquoise'
  },
  {
    color: '#3498db',
    name: 'blue'
  },
  {
    color: '#9b59b6',
    name: 'amethyst'
  },
  {
    color: '#e67e22',
    name: 'orange'
  }
]} />
```

Result:

<Palette colors={[
  {
    color: '#1abc9c',
    name: 'turquoise'
  },
  {
    color: '#3498db',
    name: 'blue'
  },
  {
    color: '#9b59b6',
    name: 'amethyst'
  },
  {
    color: '#e67e22',
    name: 'orange'
  }
]} />

### Link

This component will help you address your other documents.

```
# Hi!

<Link to="/button">Go</Link>
```


If any of the short code conflicts with any of its built components, it can disable them and use the classic import and place an alias.

To disable, add this field in your `papyrum.config.js` :

```js
// papyrum.config.js
export default {
  disableShortcuts: true,
}
```

With this the following Shortcodes will be deactivated:

- Playground
- Components
- Props
- Fonts
- Palette
- Link

Now to use them you only need to import in your `.mdx` file:

Will need to install `@papyrum/ui-docs`.

```
import { Playground as MyPlayground } from '@papyrum/ui-docs';

<MyPlayground>
  <div>My Playground</div>
</MyPlayground>

```

### Creating your own Shortcodes

To create your own Shortcodes, you must create an object that houses its components,
and pass it as props to the `Root` root component, example:

```js
// .papyrum/App.js
import React from 'react';
import { hot } from 'react-hot-loader/root';
import Root from '@papyrum/cli';
import db from './db.json';
import { imports } from './imports';

const map = {
  Shortcode: () => <div>My Shortcode!</div>
};

const App = () => <Root db={db} components={map} imports={imports} />;

export default hot(App);
```

Now you can use it in any `.mdx` file of your documentation.

```
# Example:

<Shortcode />
```

## Syntax highlighting

Code blocks are text blocks wrapped around by strings of 3 backticks. 

    ```
    const MyComponent = () => <div>Hello</div>
    ```

Code highlighting is done with [Prism React Renderer](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/prism-react-renderer).

```jsx
const MyComponent = () => <div>Hello</div>
```

By default the [Dracula](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/prism-react-renderer/blob/master/src/themes/dracula.js) theme is used.
In addition you can use any other [theme](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/prism-react-renderer/tree/master/src/themes) Prism React Renderer.

For example if you want to use the [Palenight](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/prism-react-renderer/blob/master/src/themes/palenight.js) theme you will have to configure your `papyrum.config.js`

```js
// papyrum.config.js
export default {
  prism: {
    theme: require('prism-react-renderer/themes/palenight')
  }
}
```

## Hints and callouts

 Hints and Callouts blocks are text blocks wrapped around by strings of 3 backticks. 

    ```tip Tip!
    My tip
    ```

```tip Tip!
My tip
```

    ```info Information!
    My information
    ```

```info Information!
My information
```

    ```warning Warning!
    My warning
    ```

```warning Warning!
My warning
```

## Generating table of contents

you should only add the following at the top of your `.mdx`

```
## Table of contents

## Subtitle 1

### Other

## Subtitle 2

## Subtitle 3
```

And will result, with anchors that will take you to the selected section:

- Subtitle 1
  - Other
- Subtitle 2
- Subtitle 3
