# Markdown Features

___

### MDX

By default papyrum uses [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) which is a format that allows you to write JSX
inside our Markdown documents, you can easily import your components from other files.

> All documentation files must have the extension `.mdx`

Example:
```
# Hello, *world*!

<div style={{ padding: '20px', backgroundColor: 'skyblue' }}>
  <h3>This is JSX</h3>
</div>
```

Result:

# Hello, *world*!

<div style={{ padding: '20px', backgroundColor: 'skyblue' }}>
  <h3 style={{ color: '#5C6975' }}>This is JSX</h3>
</div>



### Markdown Headers

| Header | Description |
| - | - |
| `name` | A name that represents your document in the sidebar. |
| `menu` | When you want to add your document in a new menu. |
| `route` | You can define the name of your route, example if you want your document to be in `/my-route`, `route: my-route`. |
| `status` | You can define the status of a component, papyrum handles 3 types of status that are: development, deprecated and ready. |

In your `.mdx` file:

```
---
name: Button
menu: Components
route: my-bytton
status: development
---

# Hi!
```

Result:

<CustomBrowser route="http://localhost:3000/my-button">
  <h1 style={{color: '#5C6975'}}>Hi!</h1>
</CustomBrowser>

### Syntax highlighting

Code blocks are text blocks wrapped around by strings of 3 backticks. 

    ```
    const MyComponent = () => <div>Hello</div>
    ```

Code highlighting is done with [Prism React Renderer](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/prism-react-renderer).

```jsx
const MyComponent = () => <div>Hello</div>
```

By default the [Dracula](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/prism-react-renderer/blob/master/src/themes/dracula.js) theme is used.
In addition you can use any other [theme](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/prism-react-renderer/tree/master/src/themes) Prism React Renderer.

For example if you want to use the [Palenight](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/prism-react-renderer/blob/master/src/themes/palenight.js) theme you will have to configure your `papyrum.config.js`

```
// papyrum.config.js
export default {
  prism: {
    theme: require('prism-react-renderer/themes/palenight')
  }
}
```
